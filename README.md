# 50-projects-in-10-days-challenge
I saw a lot cool "50 projects in 50 days" and "100 projects in a 100 days" challenges but recently is saw a "10 projects in 10 hours" on YouTube. So I figured I'd come up with my own fun little challenge, 50 (html, css and JavaScript) projects in 10 days. I figured since I already have proficient knowledge and experience with programming and these languages especially it should be relatively easy for me to do most of those projects in under a fortnight. However so as not to over estimate my skills and try the 10 projects in 10 hours challenge, I came up with a more suitable and still relatively difficult challenge for myself by diving the time required by 5. hence 50 projects in 10 days. This is an intermediate challenge and requires close to advance knowledge of html5, css3 and modern JavaScript. All these projects should and will be self coded without any tutorial aids, besides project documentation to understand the requirements of said projects. This is also training for my hopefully soon to happen 10 projects in 10 hours challenge
